## 🎯 The Challenge: Efficient Emergency Response

SAMU regulators face the challenge of rapidly assessing emergency situations and directing patients to the most appropriate hospitals. This process requires quick decision-making and accurate information.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: SwiftDispatch for SAMU

**SwiftDispatch** is an AI-powered tool designed to streamline emergency dispatch for SAMU regulators by:

* **Rapid Triage:** Quickly assessing patient conditions based on critical information.
* **Intelligent Hospital Redirection:** Suggesting optimal hospitals based on patient needs and real-time data.
* **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Providing actionable insights to support informed decisions.

> [!CAUTION]
> **MVP Demo Scope:** This demonstration focuses on the core triage and hospital redirection workflow for a limited set of emergency scenarios. Real-world SAMU operations involve significantly more complex factors, which will be addressed in future development phases.


---

## ✨ Key Features (MVP Demo)

* **Intuitive Emergency Triage Form:** A user-friendly interface for inputting critical patient information.
* **AI-Powered Triage and Recommendation:** Real-time analysis of patient data to suggest appropriate hospitals.
* **Mocked OpenStreetMap Integration:** A visual representation of hospital locations and potential redirection routes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Time Savings:** SwiftDispatch's streamlined triage and hospital recommendation process is designed to significantly reduce the time SAMU regulators spend on initial assessment and hospital selection, allowing for faster patient care.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

Built for speed, scalability, and rapid prototyping:

- **Frontend:** React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express for a robust API.
- **AI/ML:** Scikit-learn and Statsmodels for basic data analysis and modeling.
- **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL for lightweight data management.
- **Deployment:** Docker for containerization and easy deployment.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Future iterations of SwiftDispatch for SAMU will include:

* **Advanced AI Models:** More sophisticated AI algorithms for improved triage and recommendations.
* **Real-time Hospital Capacity Data:** Integration with real-time hospital data to optimize redirection.
* **Integration with SAMU Systems:** Seamless integration with existing SAMU systems for efficient data exchange.
* **Enhanced User Interface:** A more intuitive and user-friendly interface for SAMU regulators.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Demo Setup)

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/xxx/Hackathon-xxx`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd Hackathon-AISummit`
3. **Run `npm run dev` to start the front-end**
4. **Run `npm run server` to start the server**
5. **Access the SAMU Dispatch Interface in your browser:** `http://localhost:5173`
6. **Make sure the server is `healthy` with `curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/health`**

>[!TIP]
> The server port is either 5174 or 3000. <br/><br/>
> **Quick Start:** For the fastest demo setup, ensure both your front-end and server terminals are open *before* accessing `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. This ensures a smooth initial loading experience.
