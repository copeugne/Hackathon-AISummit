## üéØ The Challenge: Healthcare Access Bottlenecks

In many regions, including √éle-de-France, patients face long waiting periods for specialist care. These delays can lead to:
- **Delayed diagnoses**
- **Increased patient anxiety**
- **Potentially poorer health outcomes**

Existing systems often lack the intelligence to efficiently manage demand, optimize resource allocation, and guide patients to the most appropriate, timely care pathway.

---

## üí° Our Solution: DocFlow

**DocFlow** is an AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize patient access to healthcare by:
- **Predicting & Reducing Wait Times:** Forecasting appointment demand to guide patients toward faster care options.
- **Optimizing Teleconsultation (TCS):** Recommending TCS as a viable, faster alternative to in-person visits.
- **Streamlining Patient Journeys:** Offering a smart triage and booking flow to efficiently direct patients to the right specialty and appointment type.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Demo Focus:** Reducing waiting times for Cardiology appointments in √éle-de-France through a user-friendly Patient Portal experience.
